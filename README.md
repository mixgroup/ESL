# ESL
ESL stands for electronic shelf label. It's a long-awaited product, which we decided to release to **everyone**. Yes! To everyone! To you, to your friend, literally to anyone who wants to use our system.

### It's all good, but...
No, we don't forget about those awesome people, who purchased [the licence](https://www.roblox.com/game-pass/86593547/Electronic-Shelf-Label) for 49 Robux earlier. They will receive a reward within our server. As of now, we have stopped selling [the licence](https://www.roblox.com/game-pass/86593547/Electronic-Shelf-Label).
